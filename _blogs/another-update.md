## Diving Deep into LLMs

My current research at Case Western Reserve University is heavily focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This fascinating area of AI is evolving rapidly, and I'm particularly interested in:

* **Biases in LLMs:** How do they arise and how can we mitigate them?
* **Evaluation Metrics:** How can we effectively measure the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs?
* **Reasoning Abilities:** Can LLMs perform complex reasoning, and how can we improve this?

I'm also working on projects related to model pruning and efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. The goal is to make these powerful models more accessible and reliable.

More technical details to follow in future posts!
