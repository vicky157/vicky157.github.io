    "content": "## Diving Deep into LLMs\n\nMy current research at Case Western Reserve University is heavily focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This fascinating area of AI is evolving rapidly, and I'm particularly interested in:\n\n* **Biases in LLMs:** How do they arise and how can we mitigate them?\n* **Evaluation Metrics:** How can we effectively measure the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs?\n* **Reasoning Abilities:** Can LLMs perform complex reasoning, and how can we improve this?\n\nI'm also working on projects related to model pruning and efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. The goal is to make these powerful models more accessible and reliable.\n\nMore technical details to follow in future posts!"
